At the moment, I'm writing my Computer Science B. Sc. thesis on state of the art virtualization technologies at [Vector](https://www.vector.com).


- In my free time, I'm currently working on
  - 🎮 a private game project using [Bevy engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) - sorry, not published yet.
  - 🎄 Rust solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 challenge. [repo](https://github.com/nicmr/aoc2020)
- Past professional projects
  - [billing](https://github.com/nicmr/billing). An open source application I developed during my internship at NTT Data. Attributes AWS resource usage of a single billing account to multiple tenants by resource tags and generates billing invoices.
- Past side projects you might want to take a look at
  - 🎶 [fidelitas](https://github.com/nicmr/fidelitas): A Rust network audio player - use your phone or any other device in your network to control the music playing on your computer. Uses libvlc, actix-web, crossbeam and an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) frontend. The UI is nothing to write home about yet. Currently on hold due to focussing on other projects.
  - 📚 [runomicon](https://github.com/nicmr/runomicon/blob/master/src/main.rs) A simple Rust GUI application to manage "runepages" in the game League of Legends. On hold because I don't really play the game and my brother has found a tool that works decently well for him. Uses [iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) 🧊 and the League of Legends API.
- I'm interested in
  - virtualization: I've worked with Docker 🐳, Firecracker 🔥, Kubernetes, kata-containers, containerd/ctr
  - distributed systems
  - All things Rust 🦀
  - game engines: I've previously worked with [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), and [amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/), but my current favourite is [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).
  - functional programming: I like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Purescript](https://www.purescript.org/) and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and their innovative ecosystems.
  - algorithms - I love to develop algorithms for coding challenges such as [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)!
  - veganism and sustainability 🌱
  - and teaching!
